# LLDB initialization file for Magic Hands game
# This configures lldb to skip trace stops during SDL3's dynamic library loading

# Set a breakpoint on dyld_image_notifier and auto-continue
# This prevents the trace instruction from stopping the debugger
breakpoint set -n lldb_image_notifier
breakpoint command add -o "continue"

# Also disable stops on shared library events
